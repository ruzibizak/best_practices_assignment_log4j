What is Logging?
Logging is the method of capturing and recording details about events, errors, and informational messages that occur during the runtime of a software application. These captured records, or logs, are essential for gaining insights into the application's functioning, diagnosing problems, monitoring its performance, and understanding its state at various times.

Logs can contain different kinds of information:

Errors: Problems that hinder the application's correct operation.
Warnings: Issues that may not be critical but require attention.
Info: General updates about the application's activities or status.
Debug: Detailed data useful for problem-solving, including information about variable values and execution paths.
Why is Logging Important?
Logging serves several key purposes:

Troubleshooting and Debugging: Logs assist developers in identifying and resolving issues by tracking events that lead up to an error or malfunction.
Monitoring and Performance: Logs enable monitoring of the application's performance, help in tracking its behavior, and highlight potential performance issues or inefficiencies.
Auditing and Compliance: For applications dealing with sensitive data, logs offer a record that helps ensure adherence to regulatory and compliance requirements.
Operational Insights: Logs provide valuable insights into how the application is utilized, which can guide improvements and enhance user experience.
Error Recovery: Analyzing logs helps in understanding failures and devising measures to prevent future occurrences.
Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels represent the seriousness or priority of the messages being logged. They include:

TRACE: The most granular level, capturing detailed information about the application's execution flow, including all available debugging data.
DEBUG: Provides in-depth information about the application's internal state, useful for troubleshooting issues.
INFO: General updates about the application's operations, including important events like startup and shutdown.
WARN: Signifies a potential problem or situation that could lead to issues but does not halt the application's operation.
ERROR: Indicates a significant problem impacting the application's functionality, though it may still operate to some extent.
FATAL: Denotes a critical issue causing the application's abrupt termination or halting its normal operation.
